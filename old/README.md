# Crispy Fiesta

## About
Crispy Fiesta is a client managing application created while doing a freelance project for a local business. It takes in jobs via an api call from a business frontend, or via creation on the admin portal; the admins can then track, manage, and organize jobs and clients. The goal of the application was to make it easy for the staff of the business using it to easily lookup jobs or clients, take notes or edit any information, and either save it for later, or post it to the job board for workers to pick up.
